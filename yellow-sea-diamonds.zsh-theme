# REPORT RETURN CODE
# The following expression:
#   %(?.$NOERROR.$ERROR_OCCURRED)
# is a ternary conditional, which shows the second argument ($NOERROR) if the condition is true, and show the third
# argument if the condition is false.
# The condition (%?) is the return code. (Zero is true in Zsh.)
# Displays $NOERROR if previous command exited normally
# Displays $ERROR_OCCURRED otherwise
# My personal preference: Display nothing if there was no error. A lack of error isn‚Äôt sufficiently informative to
# warrant the additional visual noise.
