# REPORT RETURN CODE
# The following expression:
#   %(?.$NOERROR.$ERROR_OCCURRED)
# is a ternary conditional, which shows the second argument ($NOERROR) if the condition is true, and show the third
# argument if the condition is false.
# The condition (%?) is the return code. (Zero is true in Zsh.)
# Displays $NOERROR if previous command exited normally
# Displays $ERROR_OCCURRED otherwise
# My personal preference: Display nothing if there was no error. A lack of error isn‚Äôt sufficiently informative to
# warrant the additional visual noise.

# Although ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_SUFFIX is often used as the vehicle for displaying the commit hash, I ran into 
# a problem I wasn't able to solve when using ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_SUFFIX for that purpose: the commit hash
# wouldn't update automatically.
# However, by appending it to the prompt myself, I don't have that problem.
# The limitation that creates (as least as of the current state) is that I can't wrap the commit hash in
# delimiters, because those delimiters would display even when there is no commit hash.
